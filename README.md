<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The SkipSelection project is a web application designed to help users interactively select different options related to waste management services. The application features a responsive and intuitive interface, allowing users to easily choose options like postcode, waste type, skip size, and more. The design aims to provide a seamless user experience across various devices, including mobile phones and tablets, with dynamic animations for banners and buttons.

The project is built with React (Vite) and CSS, ensuring high performance and flexibility. This tech stack also allows users to easily interact with the service selection process in a fast and responsive manner.

<h2>Project Goals and Approach</h2>
For this project, I focused on recreating the basic elements to maintain consistency with the rest of the website and avoid disrupting its overall design. While the result isn't perfect, my primary goal was to replicate the overall aesthetic of the site in a way that allows for easy and quick layout changes in the future.

I chose to emphasize the dynamic generation of elements and specific properties, such as image badges, to achieve a cleaner and more modular result. My work specifically focused on this page, without delving into aspects like header progression during the ordering process or the functionality of the footer buttons.

<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
To ensure the project is responsive, I decided to focus on two main screen formats:

Mobile (Pixel 7)

Tablet (iPad Pro)

This approach allows the application to cater to a wide range of users, ensuring it functions seamlessly on both small and medium-sized screens.
